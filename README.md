## Where do I Start

This Repo is a companion to ['Cloud Careers and Certifications'](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/cloud-computing-careers-and-certifications-first-steps) on LinkedIn Learning or Lynda.com course.  It's a useful first course for those who are new working with public cloud services.

## How to Find the Info by Vendor

- See the main file in each vendor folders for links
  - for AWS go to `\AWS` folder -> `README.md`

## How to select a Cloud Vendor

Selecting one or more cloud vendors is a key choice when adopting public cloud services.  The global market trends (shown below) can be seen as a starting point for you.  

![Trends](https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-cloud/blob/master/images/trends.png)  

It is important to further refine your selection based on the following:

- **cloud services needed** - does a potential vendor offer your desired services?
- **cloud services location** - does a potential vendor have your desired services in your geography?
- **community cloud skills** - what is the size of the technical community in your geography for a potential vendor?
