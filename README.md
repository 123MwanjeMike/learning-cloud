## How to Start

- REVIEW - this Repo is a companion to my ['Cloud Careers and Certifications'](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/cloud-computing-careers-and-certifications-first-steps-2) course on LinkedIn Learning or Lynda.com course.  It's a useful first course for those who are new working with public cloud services.
- SELECT a cloud vendor, set up a free trial (test) account for learning
- SETUP a budget alert on your test account - I suggest alerting on spend of over $ 50 USD per day
- SELECT a scenario or service to start learning
- BUILD and Learn...repeat!

## How to Find the Info by Cloud Vendor

- See the main file in each vendor folders for links
  - for **AWS** go to `\AWS` folder -> `README.md`
  - for **GCP** go to `\GCP` folder -> `README.md`, etc...

## How to Select a Cloud Vendor

Selecting one or more cloud vendors is a key choice when adopting public cloud services.  The global market trends (shown below) can be seen as a starting point for you.  

![Trends](https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-cloud/blob/master/images/trends.png)  

It is important to further refine your selection based on the following:

- **services needed** 
  - does a potential vendor offer your desired services in their cloud?
  - comparing service x vendor, which fits best?
  - example: does `AWS IoT` or `Azure IoT` better meet your needs?
- **services location(s)** 
  - does a potential vendor have your desired services in your preferred location(s)?
  - where are their data center(s)?
- **community cloud skills** 
  - what is the size of the total technical community for a potential vendor? 
   - what is the size of the local technical community in your geography for a potential vendor?
